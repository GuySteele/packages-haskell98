This package contains the Haskell 98 Standard Libraries, which are
always available to every Haskell program.  The implementations of
these libraries however reside elsewhere in the hierarchy (the modules
here mostly just re-export the contents of other libraries).

For more information on the standard libraries, please see the Haskell
98 Library Report, here: <http://www.haskell.org/onlinelibrary/>.
